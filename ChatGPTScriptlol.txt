Creating a wholesale real estate website under the name HouseDispo requires a slightly different approach compared to traditional real estate websites. Wholesale real estate typically involves purchasing properties below market value, often in bulk, and selling them quickly to investors, rehabbers, or landlords. The site should be tailored to appeal to investors, sellers, and buyers looking for quick, discounted property deals.
